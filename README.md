# dotfiles
Configuration for a development setup on linux.

## Implementation
- Clone to ~/.dotfiles and use gnu stash to symlink config files to /home.

## Goals
- Configuration is portable across distros and ready to be applied to fresh distro installations.
- Configure for my needs. These dotfiles are a snapshot of my progress in configuring an ideal development setup based on my needs. As my needs are realized or changed, so do these dotfiles.
- Avoid unecessary bloat. Only plugins and settings that are utilized frequently, or else have significant impact on my development process, should be included.
